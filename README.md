# MicroAuth
A micro-frontend, or **mife**, that authenticates against Firebase and provides access to a [mifedom](https://github.com/Micro-cosm/micro-mifedom) constellation.

To encourage rapid iteration/deployment, this project has been updated to work seamlessly with [bin-go](https://github.com/wejafoo/bin-go)

We value your perspective and invite you to participate in discovering new mife techniques and methods, regardless of your skill-level. Because of the shared common purpose,
**we strive to quickly respond to hackathon use cases**.

----
**Caution:**  This project is heavily-opinionated with bias towards Nodejs(Typescript)/GoLang/Angular(CLI)/Google(GCP)/Kubernetes.

A few goals of the overarching Micro-cosm project:

- Use latest lts node implementation
- Use latest angular cli
- Use `ng new <PROJECT NAME>` to create each new mife
- Use @angular/schematics wherever available to install libraries
- Use @angular/cli best practice and default libraries
- Use the latest library version of the most active project that serves the need
- Target **90% code coverage** as contribution acceptance criteria
- Optimize for rapid GCP deployments and infrastructure support, reserving hybrid cloud topics for secondary consideration.

This project was initially generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.7.
